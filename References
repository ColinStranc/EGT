	abstract = {A report of experiments on aspects of the learning problem conducted under the author's direction at Teachers' College. Wants, interests and attitudes are related by implication to such factors as relevance and belongingness, which are responsible for the confirming reaction at the basis of the law of effect. It is shown again that learning can take place when only tendencies are learned, that adjacent connections on both sides of the rewarded ones are strengthened, and that connections can be formed without awareness on the part of the subject either of the nature of the connection of the fact that it is being formed. Part II is concerned with changes in wants. It is shown that they may change somewhat under the influence of various degrees of reward and punishment, and possibly also as a result of simple repetition, though it is difficult to separate this from some degree of reward. The influence of punishments, particularly as their amount, is studied. There are chapters on the history of the use of rewards and punishments and on practical applications, appendices giving in extenso the material used, bibliography, and index.

	abstract = {People approach pleasure and avoid pain. To discover the true nature of approach–avoidance motivation, psychologists need to move beyond this hedonic principle to the principles that underlie the different ways that it operates. One such principle is regulatory focus, which distinguishes self-regulation with a promotion focus (accomplishments and aspirations) from self-regulation with a prevention focus (safety and responsibilities). This principle is used to reconsider the fundamental nature of approach–avoidance, expectancy–value relations, and emotional and evaluative sensitivities. Both types of regulatory focus are applied to phenomena that have been treated in terms of either promotion (e.g., well-being) or prevention (e.g., cognitive dissonance). Then, regulatory focus is distinguished from regulatory anticipation and regulatory reference, 2 other principles underlying the different ways that people approach pleasure and avoid pain.
